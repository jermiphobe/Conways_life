As per Wikipedia, The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

Here are the rules:

* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
* Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
* All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
